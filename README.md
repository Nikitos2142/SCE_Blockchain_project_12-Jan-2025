In the article "Trust at Scale: The Economic Limits of Cryptocurrencies and Blockchains” by Eric Budish, ( published in Quarterly Journal of Economics, October 16, 2024) it is highlighted the needing 
for innovations in blockchain design due to several fundamental challenges. One of them, which the most crucial, from my point of view, is the linear cost-scaling issue. 
This means that the cost of securing a blockchain increases proportionally with the economic value it protects. In traditional trust systems (e.g., legal systems, banking), 
costs do not scale in the same way due to economies of scale and complementary mechanisms.
Following strategy is choosen to address this inefficiency: 
-	Integration with traditional legal and economic system
A smart contract is written which is be based on the mentioned strategy.
Tools.
Remix IDE - developing, testing, and deploying smart contract, which is written in Solidity 
Visual Studio Code – is used for Solidity development, writing the tests for contract (with Mocha), and with aim of further integration with front – end and building an application
Truffle – tool, which manages wallets and private keys, allows signing transactions for deployment or interaction with a blockchain. Apart from that, it connects to blockchain networks like Ethereum via an HD wallet (e.g., with a mnemonic phrase).
Ganache – tool, which creates a local blockchain network. It provides a local Ethereum blockchain for development and testing and simulates blockchain behavior for testing smart contracts without using real network resources.
Mocha –  JavaScript testing framework and it is used to write and execute tests for smart contracts to ensure correctness and functionality. 
Solc – Solidity compiler, which compiles smart contracts written in Solidity into bytecode for deployment to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
Web3 -  JavaScript library for interacting with Ethereum. It enables communication with the Ethereum blockchain, including calling smart contract functions and sending transactions.
